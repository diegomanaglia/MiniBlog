# Mini Blog React App

This project was made using React JS in front-end and Firebase in back-end.

In this project, I learned several very important techniques with React + Firebase, such as:

- User creation and authentication;
- Creating, editing, and deleting posts with images;
- Understanding the structure of React.

It was a very important project for honing my skills with React.
